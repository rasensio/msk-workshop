# Exersice #1 - Producing and Consuming Messages

## 1. Create the topic

You will create the topic ``metrics`` where the messages will be published and later consumers will read them using an offset.

```shell
cd ~/environment/msk-workshop-apps
node topic $CLUSTER metrics
```

Congrats! you just created the ``metrics`` topic.
