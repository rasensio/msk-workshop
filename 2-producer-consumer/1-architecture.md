# Exersice #1 - Producing and Consuming Messages

> [!TIP]
> You will run a producer and a consumer of your MSK Cluster and dump the messages in the console of Cloud9

## This is the final architecture of what this exercise is about

The application you downloaded (msk-workshop-apps) contains a **producer** script and a **consumer** script. These will be used in the next excersice to show a basic pub/sub architecture.
